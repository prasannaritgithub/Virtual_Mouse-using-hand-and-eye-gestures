# Virtual_Mouse-using-hand-and-eye-gestures
This repository contains a virtual mouse application built with Python. It offers two control methods: one using hand gestures detected by a webcam and another using eye movements. The GUI is created with Tkinter, providing a simple interface to launch either mode.
